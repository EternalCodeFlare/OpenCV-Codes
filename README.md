# OpenCV-Codes
   
   ### Computer Vision has become very important because it gives computers the ability to see and acts as eyes for computers.
   
   ***There are many different libraries for many tasks in Python that makes it so good and powerful.*** When we study about Computer vision i.e we work with images then **OpenCV** is very essential library because it has many good applications and also it can be easily linked with our OS and hence some of the features like our camera can be accessed easily with just few lines of code. 

### Some basic codes for OpenCV have been included in this repo also one video is been given to check the program of ***Background Subtraction***!!
